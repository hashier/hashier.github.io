            <p>This is a small (incomplete) list of projects that I have started over the years and that have had some impact on me in one way or another.
Starting with my very first successful C project that allowed transfer of files between a famous gateway router (<a href="https://fli4l.de">fli4l</a>) and a local machine, flicp.</p>
<p>You can find most of my projects on <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> or by clicking on them below.</p>
<h2 id="1-2-animationhttpshashiergithubio1-2-animation"><a href="https://hashier.github.io/1-2-animation/">1-2-animation</a></h2>
<p>This command line tool generates Poemotion images.
These are 2D images that provide an optical illusion of being 3D when viewed with a striped masked.</p>
<p>A video of this effect can be found on the project&rsquo;s GitHub page.</p>
<p>Written in Go.</p>

<p>Whether you want to filtering your playlists by genre, country of artist or just simply randomise it, this app can do it for you.</p>
<p>Written in Objective-C with different Frameworks like CocoaLibSpotify and ENiOS.</p>
<h2 id="idlesoundhttpshashiergithubioidlesound"><a href="https://hashier.github.io/idleSound/">idleSound</a></h2>

<p>Mac Menubar UI App, written in Objective-C.</p>
<h2 id="sskeychainhttpsgithubcomsoffessskeychain"><a href="https://github.com/soffes/sskeychain/">SSKeychain</a></h2>
<p>Objective-C wrapper around the iOS/OS X keychain.

<h2 id="macfolkethttpshashiergithubiomacfolket"><a href="https://hashier.github.io/MacFolket/">MacFolket</a></h2>
<p>MacFolket is a Swedish/English dictionary that is deeply integrated into OS~X.</p>
<p>After finding a dictionary database under the CC license, I decided to develop a program that facilitates reading Swedish webpages.</p>
<p>Implemented in XSLT (I started a Golang rewrite recently).</p>
<h2 id="gimp-cuda-pluginhttpsgithubcomhashiergicu"><a href="https://github.com/hashier/gicu/">GIMP CUDA-Plugin</a></h2>
<p>GIMP plugin written to use GPU acceleration.</p>
<p>The plugin extends GIMP to apply various filters on images with the help of the graphics card.
This is done by transfer of heavy calculations to the GPU.</p>
<p>As far as I know, this was the very first every written GIMP plugin
that off loaded the heavy math calculations to the graphics card.</p>
<p>Written in C, X11, GTK+ and CUDA.</p>

<h2 id="flicphttpswwwfli4lde"><a href="https://www.fli4l.de/">flicp</a></h2>
<p>My initiation into the world of developing software.</p>
<p>fli4l.de is a Linux based ISDN-, DSL- and Ethernet-router.
The communication with the system service utilized a special
protocol thatwas only implemented in a program for Windows.
I wrote flicp to be able to transfer files to and from Unix/Linux
based systems to the service</p>
<p>Written in ANSI C.</p>
